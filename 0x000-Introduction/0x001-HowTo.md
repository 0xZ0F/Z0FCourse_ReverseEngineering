# 0x001 - How To Follow This Course

## File Structure:

Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. They usually contain things like images used in the course. All course content should be numbered in pseudo-hexadecimal. Feel free to use these numbers when asking questions or making comments. Here's an example tweet: "@0xZ0F there is a spelling mistake in 0x101." Be cautious though, The number for a chapter or section may change in the future.

* Each folder (Ex. [0x000-Introduction](0x000-Introduction)) is a **chapter**.
* Each file (Ex. [0x001-HowTo.md](0x001-HowTo.md)) is a **section**.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you're unsure what they mean go to [Lingo.md](../Lingo.md).

If you haven't already, please read [README.md](../README.md).
