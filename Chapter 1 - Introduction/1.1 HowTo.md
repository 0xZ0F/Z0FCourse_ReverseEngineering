# 1.1 How To Follow This Course

## File Structure:

Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. They usually contain things like images used in the course. You will notice that every chapter and lesson is numbered. Feel free to use these numbers when asking questions or making comments. Here's an example tweet: "@0xZ0F there is a spelling mistake in 1.1." Be cautious though, the number for a chapter or lesson may change in the future.

* Each folder (Ex. [Chapter 1 - Introduction](../Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction/)) is a **chapter**.
* Each file (Ex. [1.1 HowTo.md](1.1%20HowTo.md)) is a **lesson**.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you're unsure what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](../Lingo.md).

If you haven't already, please read [README.md](../README.md).
