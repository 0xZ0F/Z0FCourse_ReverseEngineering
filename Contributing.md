# Contributing

Thank you to anyone who contributes to this course in any way. The community allows this course to be much better than one man alone could.

## Credit

I try to always give credit to those who help contribute to the course. If you're making a pull request, you can add yourself to [Credit.md](Credit.md). If you don't, I will, unless you don't want to be listed. You can list your real name, social media account, or anything else as long as I approve of it.

## How To Contribute

Here are some ways you can let me know about, or submit, your contribution.

* Make a pull request.
* Open an issue.
* Contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F).
* Contact me on Discord.
    * Username: @z0f
    * Server: [https://discord.gg/73tkPGv](https://discord.gg/73tkPGv)

## Types Of Contribution

Any contributions are accepted as long as they improve the course in some way.

> If you have any questions about contributing (or anything else) let me know. Nothing is too ambitious or stupid.

* Requests for new topics or information to be added to the course are accepted. Submit them via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F) or by opening an issue.
* There are plenty of spelling and link mistakes. Have fun.
* If you want to add a whole chapter or lesson, go for it.
* Feel free to contribute to WIP content. However, if you make a pull request be warned that it may be closed without being merged. If this is done it's because I will weave your work into my version. With that said, I will of course give you explicit credit in the lesson (and [Credit.md](Credit.md)).

## Standards

* Be sure everything you contribute is accurate. I will fact check everything myself as well.
* The language in the course needs to be professional (no vulgar language or slang). 
* I don't expect you to dedicate egregious amounts of time contributing. For example, if there is a broken link in every lesson instead of fixing every link yourself, let me know and I'll fix them.
