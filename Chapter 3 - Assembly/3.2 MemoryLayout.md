# 3.2 Memory Layout - Update Soon
The system's memory is organized in a specific way. This is done to make sure everything has a place to reside in.

## Assembly Segments
There are different segments/sections in which data or code is stored. They are laid out in the following order:  
* **Stack** - Holds non-static local variables. Discussed more in-depth soon.
* **Heap** - Contains *dynamically* allocated data that can be uninitialized at first.
* **.data** - Contains global and static data initialized to a *non-zero value*.
* **.bss** - Contains global and static data that is *uninitialized or initialized to zero*.
* **.text** - Contains the code of the program (don't blame me for the name, I didn't make it).

## Overview of Memory Sections

Here is a general overview of how memory is laid out in Windows. **This is extremely simplified.**

* **Stack** - Area in memory that can be used quickly for static data allocation. Imagine the stack with low addresses at the top and high address at the bottom. This is identical to a normal numerical list. Data is read and written as "last-in-first-out" (LIFO). The LIFO structure of the stack is often represented with a stack of plates. You can't simply take out the third plate from the top, you have to take off one plate at a time to get to it. You can only access the piece of data that's on the top of the stack, so to access other data you need to move what's on top out of the way. When I said that the stack holds static data I'm referring to data that has a known length such as an integer. The size of an integer is defined at compile-time, the size is typically 4 bytes, so we can throw that on the stack. Unless a maximum length is specified, user input should be stored on the heap because the data has a variable size. *However*, the address/location of the input will probably be stored on the stack for future reference. When you put data on top of the stack you **push** it onto the stack. **When data is pushed onto the stack, the stack grows up, towards lower memory addresses.** When you remove a piece of data off the top of the stack you **pop** it off the stack. **When data is popped off the stack, the stack shrinks down, towards higher addresses.** That all may seem odd, but remember, it's like a normal numerical list where 1, the lower number, is at the top. 10, the higher number, is at the bottom. Two registers are used to keep track of the stack. The **stack pointer (RSP/ESP/SP)** is used to keep track of the top of the stack and the **base pointer (RBP/EBP/BP)** is used to keep track of the base/bottom of the stack. This means that when data is pushed onto the stack, the stack pointer is increased since the stack grew towards higher addresses. The base pointer has no reason to change when we push or pop something to/from the stack. We'll talk about both the stack pointer and base pointer more as time goes on.

> Be warned, you will sometimes see the stack represented the other way around, but the way I'm teaching it is how you'll see it in the real world.

* **Heap** - Similar to the stack but used for dynamic allocation and it's a little slower to access. The heap is typically used for data that is dynamic (changing or unpredictable). Things such as structures and user input might be stored on the heap. If the size of the data isn't known at compile-time, it's usually stored on the heap. **When you add data to the heap it grows towards higher addresses.**
* **Program Image** - This is the program/executable loaded into memory. On Windows, this is typically a **Portable Executable (PE)**.

> Don't worry too much about the TEB and PEB for now. This is just a brief introduction to them.
* **TEB** - The **Thread Environment Block (TEB)** stores information about the currently running thread(s).
* **PEB** - The **Process Environment Block (PEB)** stores information about the process and the loaded modules. One piece of information the PEB contains is "BeingDebugged" which can be used to determine if the current process is being debugged.

Here's a quick example diagram of the stack and heap with some data on them.

In the diagram above, `stackVar1` was created before `stackVar2`, likewise for the heap variables.

## Stack Frames
Stack frames are chunks of data for functions. This data includes local variables, the saved base pointer, the return address of the caller, and function parameters. Consider the following example:
```c
int Square(int x){
    return x*x;
}
int main(){
    int num = 5;
    Square(5);
}
```
In this example, the `main()` function is called first. When `main()` is called, a stack frame is created for it. The stack frame for `main()`, before the function call to `Square()`, includes the local variable `num` and the parameters passed to it (in this case there are no parameters passed to main). When `main()` calls `Square()` the base pointer (RBP) and the return address are both saved. Remember, the base pointer points to the base/bottom of the stack. The base pointer is saved because when a function is called, the base pointer is updated to point to the base of that function's stack. Once the function returns, the base pointer is restored so it points to the base of the caller's stack frame. The return address is saved so once the function returns, the program knows where to resume execution. The return address is the next instruction after the function call. So in this case the return address is the end of the `main()` function. That may sound confusing, hopefully, this can clear it up:
```asm
mov RAX, 15 ;RAX = 15
call func   ;Call func. Same as func();
mov RBX, 23 ;RBX = 23. This line is saved as the return address for the function call.
```
I know that this can be a bit confusing but it is quite simple in how it works. It just may not be intuitive at first. It's simply telling the computer where to go (what instruction to execute) when the function returns. You don't want it to execute the instruction that called the function because that will cause an infinite loop. This is why the next instruction is used as the return address instead. So in the above example, RAX is set to 15, then the function called `func` is called. Once it returns it's going to start executing at the return address which is the line that contains `mov RBX, 23`.

Here is the layout of a stack frame:

Note the location of everything. This will be helpful in the future.

## Endianness

Given the value of 0xDEADBEEF, how should it be stored in memory? This has been debated for a while and still strikes arguments today. At first, it may seem intuitive to store it as it is, but when you think of it from a computer's perspective it's not so straightforward. Because of this, there are two ways computers can store data in memory - big-endian and little-endian.
* Big Endian - The **most** significant byte (far left) is stored first. This would be 0xDEADBEEF from the example.
* Little Endian - The **least** significant byte (far right) is stored first. This would be 0xEFBEADDE from the example.

## Data Storage
Data is stored in memory. Memory can be access byte by byte. This is quite a simple concept, but you need to understand it. Take a look at the following example:
<p align="center">
  <img src="[ignore]/InMemoryRF.png">
</p>
If we were going to refer to the data 12345678 we would say that it's stored at 0xFFF00000. However, this isn't entirely true. It's actually stored starting at 0xFFF00000 to 0xFFF0000C. I just want to make sure that you understand that data is stored byte-by-byte. Also, it's important to realize that if you're attempting to store data into a register, it will store the number of bytes appropriate for that register. So if you attempted to store what's at the address of 0xFFF00000 into a 4-byte register, you'd get 4 bytes of data in that register. Attempting to store the data in 0xFFF00000 into an 8-byte register will get 8 bytes, which goes beyond the range shown in the image. This probably isn't going to cause issues, but it's something to watch for.

* 12 is at 0xFFF00000
* 34 is at 0xFFF00004
* 56 is at 0xFFF00008
* 78 is at 0xFFF0000C

Again, this is quite a simple concept but you need to be sure that you understand it.

## RBP & RSP on x64
On x64, it's common to see RBP used in a non-traditional way. Sometimes only RSP is used to point to data on the stack such as local variables and function parameters, and RBP is used for general data (similar to RAX). This will be discussed in further detail later.
