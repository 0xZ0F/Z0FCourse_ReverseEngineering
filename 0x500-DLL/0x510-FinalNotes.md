# Final Notes
I would consider this to be our first real reversing project. There was a significant amount of information covered. If you're confused by anything please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/m3DRPyV). There are no dumb questions! You should be able to DM me, if not just tweet at me asking to DM. I encourage you to write your own programs and reverse them. That's by far the best way to learn this stuff. We will now be moving on to reversing executables. If you haven't already, take a break!
