# 0x401 - Before We Begin
I'm excited that we are now to this point in the course. If I'm being honest, all that other stuff is pretty boring. This is the real fun stuff!

Before we start reverse engineering you need to be sure that you understand what we have covered up to this point. Use content outside of this course if you need to. 

I know that there's going to be people who don't have C/C++ knowledge that is going to try to take this course. For the final time, I'm going to tell those people that **you need to learn C/C++ before you continue** if you have not already.

I want to warn you that things may get a bit confusing at this point. I assure you that it's normal. I struggled to wrap my head around many concepts but eventually, it clicked. We all learn differently so do what you need to do. This isn't easy stuff to learn for most people, so hang in there. If you need any help you can contact me on Twitter [@0xZ0F](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F). 

**Don't worry about asking questions that you think are dumb. There is no question as dumb as letting yourself fail because you didn't want to reach out to get some help.**
