# 6.8 MysteryFunc
I decided to introduce you to reversing with some DLL exports because we have the function names. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. This function, even though it's quite small, will be a little preview of what to expect very soon.

Here is the disassembly of `MysteryFunc`:

This function seems to take two parameters because both RCX and RDX are used.

* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX], RCX` - RDX looks like a pointer into some data structure because of how it's being used. What I mean by this is that it's being accessed with offsets (Ex. +0x8) which is an indicator of some sort of data structure. This could be an array or a class (or something similar). This code will move RCX (first parameter) into [RDX] (address pointed to by the second parameter). RDX is a pointer of some kind.
* `LEA RAX, QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x4]` - Loads the address of `RCX + 0x4` into RAX. Because an offset from RCX is being used, this makes me think that RCX is also some sort of data structure.
* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX + 0x8], RCX` - Move RCX (the first parameter) into RDX + 0x8.
* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX + 0x10], RAX` - Move RAX (the address of RCX + 0x4) into RDX + 0x10. Okay, RDX is definitely some sort of structure or array.
* `LEA RAX, QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x8]` - Load the address of RCX + 0x8 into RAX.
* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX + 0x18], RAX` - Move RAX into RDX + 0x18.
* `MOV RAX, RCX` - RCX is moved into RAX as a return value. This tells us that this function returns a pointer to some structure. Note that this structure is also the second parameter. It's odd that it's returning an unmodified parameter, but that's how it is. 
  
Let's break it down. It appears that the function takes two parameters that are both some kind of data structures (struct, class, array, etc). As a quick note, when data structures are passed it's just their starting/base address that gets passed. From that address the function accesses elements in the structure via offsets. Maybe this function is some form of initialization/setup code for a data structure. It appears that the overall purpose for this function is to copy stuff from one data structure into another data structure. One thing that I find interesting is that the data structures are not aligned. An example of what I mean is something like `x[0] = x[1]`. That means this isn't just a plain data structure copy function. Maybe it's adding extra data, or maybe they are two different structures. Let's reanalyze the code with our new found knowledge. 

* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX], RCX` - The address of the RCX data structure is put into the first element of the RDX data structure.
* `LEA RAX, QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x4]` - The address of the second parameter in the RCX data structure is moved into RAX. Here RAX is being used as a middle-man to move addresses into the structures. This is done because you can't do something like `MOV RDX + 0x8, [RCX + 0x4]`.
* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX + 0x8], RCX` - RCX is moved into the second element in the RDX data structure. I know this is the second element and not the third (as it would be if there were 3, 4 byte integer elements at offsets +0x0, +0x4 +0x8) because the first element in RDX is an address (specified by RCX). This DLL is 64-bit, so the address is most likely 64 bits (8 bytes). So the first element is a 64-bit (8 bytes) address, not 4 bytes like you may be used to. 
  
So how do we know how many elements are in RCX? There can most certainly be more elements in a data structure than we see being used. This goes for any data structure. In this case we at least know that the elements we see are 4 bytes because they are being accessed like RCX+0x4, RCX+0x8 and not RCX+0x8, RCX+0x10 in the case of 8 bytes.

* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX + 0x10], RAX` - Move RAX (the address of the second element in the RCX data structure) into the third element in the RDX data structure.
* `LEA RAX, QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x8]` - Move the address of the third element in the RCX data structure into RAX.
* `MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RDX + 0x18], RAX` - Move RAX (the address of the third element in the RCX data structure) into the fourth element of the RDX data structure.
* `MOV RAX, RCX` - Return the first parameter, which is the address of a data structure. Once again, this is odd because RCX contains an unmodified parameter (so why return it?), and RCX was already copied into the RDX data structure. It may seem pointless, weird, or even redundant but you'll be surprised what you see when reversing.

So overall it appears that we are moving the addresses of the elements in one data structure into another data structure.

Hey, now it's starting to make sense! We still aren't sure what the data structures are. They could be classes, arrays, or any other data structure type. In reality the difference is between a class and array is very small. Let's take a look at some pseudo-code of what we can guess is going on.

If they are both classes:

```c++
class MyClass{
public:
	int x, y, z;
};
class AddrClass {
public:
	void* addrOfOldClass;
	int *x, *y, *z;
};

void* CopyClass(MyClass* oldClass, AddrClass* newClass) {
	newClass->addrOfOldClass = oldClass; //addr of oldClass
	newClass->x = (int*)&oldClass->x; //addr of oldClass->x
	newClass->y = (int*)&oldClass->y;
	newClass->z = (int*)&oldClass->z;
	return oldClass;
}

int main() {
	MyClass oldClass;
	myClass1.x = 10;
	myClass1.y = 20;
	myClass1.z = 30;

	AddrClass newClass;
	CopyClass(&oldClass, &newClass);
}
```

If they are both arrays:

```c++
void* CopyArray(int oldArray[], void* newArray[]) {
	newArray[0] = &oldArray; //addr of oldArray
	newArray[1] = &oldArray[0]; //addr of oldArray[0]
	newArray[2] = &oldArray[1];
	newArray[3] = &oldArray[2];
	return &oldArray;
}

int main() {
	int myArray[3] = { 1,2,3 };
	void* addrArray[4]; //array of pointers
	CopyArray(myArray, addrArray);
}
```

Hopefully now you understand what it is the `MysteryFunc` is doing.

## Here is the actual code of the function:
> You can ignore `extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)`. `__declspec(dllexport)` which defines the function as a DLL export and `extern "C"` which prevents name mangling. I obtained the source code because I wrote the DLL we're reversing.

```c++
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void* MysteryFunc(Player* player, int* arr[]) {
	arr[0] = (int*)player;
	arr[1] = (int*)&player->score;
	arr[2] = (int*)&player->health;
	arr[3] = (int*)&player->name;
	return player;
}
```

As you can see, we pretty much nailed it. The actual code reveals that both a class and array were used. More specifically, the contents of a class are copied into an array. In this case there isn't any way we could have known if the parameters were classes or arrays with just static analysis. On a low-level, both structures and arrays are accessed the same way. We knew that the parameters were data structures, but it was impossible for us to know what kind. The only way we could have been more precise is by debugging a program that uses the DLL and analyzing how it uses `MysteryFunc()`. 

I really enjoyed this lesson. This sort of problem/puzzle solving is why I enjoy reversing so much. This was a simple example, I assure you that we will look at more complex examples soon.
