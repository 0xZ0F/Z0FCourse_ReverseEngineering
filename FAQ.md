**A:** Because it's easy to format things that look good. When I can get a chance, I'll provide PDF versions as well. Markdown files are best for viewing the course on GitHub and the PDFs are best if you decide to download the course to your computer. Markdown is also easy to read both when editing the text and viewing the product.
