# 0x600 - Malware.

# Before We Begin
This chapter is going to focus on reversing a piece of light malware. It's not very malicious which is why I hesitate to call it malware. You don't *need* a VM to reverse this malware because it is harmless. I do still recommend a VM for this section just so you have one for the future and so you can get some experience with it. How do I know the "malware" is safe? I wrote it. I don't want to spoil anything, but this "malware" doesn't even steal user information. The only risk you are taking with the "malware" is ending up with an executable that you can't find. Even that shouldn't happen.

With that said...

**By running the program you agree to take full responsibility for anything it does. I (the author) am not responsible.**

## Why Reverse Malware?
By reverse engineering malware we can learn how it works. By figuring out how it works we may be able to figure out how to stop it, what vulnerabilities it's targeting, what exploits it's using, what's it's goal, who made it, and so on. It's also common to reverse malware that's taking advantage of a zero-day in an attempt to rip the zero-day. This is commonly done by malware researchers to find the zero-day and get it patched. Criminals may also do this so they can use the zero-day someone else found for their own attacks. We are going to focus on reversing the malware in an attempt to stop it.

When reversing malware we will tend to do things slightly differently. For example, previously we really didn't care what imports the program had. For a piece of malware, you'll always look at the imports. Malware authors try to make their programs as small as possible. Also, knowing the exports can help us guess as to what the malware is doing. For example, if the malware has a bunch of imports that deal with the registry then we can guess the malware is making a registry key (possibly for persistance). If there are file imports, we know that we need to monitor the file system because the malware is going to make changes to it. Analyzing the exports on a typical program isn't as useful but it isn't always pointless either. For a conventional program, viewing imports can help identify custom libraries and their purpose. Typically that's not super useful, but it does help build a picture of the programs structure.
