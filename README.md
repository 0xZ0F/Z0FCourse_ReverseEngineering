# ATTENTION:
## **This course is still in early development. I plan on adding a significant amount of content. For now, this course is going to be hosted here on Github, however, that will most likely change in the future. To stay updated, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F).**

### Message about my future and the future of the reverse engineering course: https://0xz0f.github.io/Blog/Updates/03222020.html

This course is a side project, so updates may be slow. The course is free, and it will remain that way, so don't expect me to spend countless hours working on it. Thank you.

## What We'll Do/Learn:
This course is going to teach anyone how to reverse engineer x64 Windows. We will start by covering some basics of binaries, then reverse some small samples, reverse a DLL and implement it into our own program, reverse some malware, then look at some realistic situations.

## Why I Made This Course
Reversing is made so much harder because of the lack of resources to learn it. Most content is outdated, overpriced, hard to follow, or low quality. Reversing is already considered by many to be a difficult field to get into. Something being difficult isn't an issue, but when it gets needlessly difficult there is an issue. After reading multiple books, countless blog posts, extensive documentation, following multiple YouTube "tutorials", and much more, I feel like it's time for someone to make a dedicated course. I don't think it should be that hard to learn one topic. I certainly don't want people to have to go through the mess I went through, so I decided to make this course. I love this field and I wanted to give back to the community. Here's my gift to you and the rest of the community. Hopefully there are a few people out there that this course can help.
