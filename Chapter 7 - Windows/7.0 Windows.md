# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT (Chapter 7 - Windows)
This chapter will cover some of the basic inner workings of the Windows OS. Most of the topics will only be covered on a basic level and only the necessary information will be covered. There is a lot to the Windows OS, far too much to put into this course. If you want to know more details, the "Windows Internals" books are a fantastic resource. And remember when I said there's a lot to know, there's a part 1 and part 2 to those books, each being about 600-700 pages with a slightly below average font size.

## This chapter is currently in development and is **NOT** ready.
