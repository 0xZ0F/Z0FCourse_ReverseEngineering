# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT (Chapter 7 - Windows)
This chapter will cover some of the basic inner workings of the Windows OS. Most of the topics will only be covered on a basic level and only the necessary information will be covered. There is a lot to the Windows OS, far too much to put into this course. If you want to know more details, the ["Windows Internals" books](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189) are a fantastic resource. And remember when I said there's a lot to know, there's a part 1 and part 2 to those books, each being about 800 pages.

Because of the enormity of Windows, I will only cover what's needed or good to know in this course. I will provide plenty of links for further learning.

## This chapter is currently in development and is **NOT** ready.
